  summary: "I'm a Junior at Cornell studying Information Science. I previously studied business, but then realized banking wasn't the move. I got into product design since I was interested in behavioral economics and art, and the combinations of both fields led me here. I've previously worked at Facebook, Intuit, Function of Beauty, startups around Dallas, and freelancing.",
  passion: "Passion for experience design, with focus on building functional and usable products Doing research, value propositions and information structure Strong eye for clean, pixel perfect design and a relentless attention to detail Sketching, creating wireframes, prototyping, storytelling Usability testing, identifying red routes and card sorting Strong sense of design theory and typography. Very positive attitude with an empathetic and holistic view.",
  friends: "I've gotten to know a bunch of awesome designers the past few years. I've learned a lot from them after working with them and maybe having a drink or two. I'm incredibly excited to learn and grow with them as we become the future of the tech industry.",
